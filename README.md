SemEval 2023 ValueEval: Identification of Human Values behind Arguments

The aim of this project is to provide a solutionto the multi-label Human Value Detection problemfrom the Task 4 of Touché SemEval 2023,which consists in classifying whether or not agiven textual argument belongs to a given humanvalue category. The Touché Human Value Detection Challenge2023 employs Natural Language Processing toidentify values in argument mining. This task involvesclassifying a premise, a stance and a conclusioninto a total of 20 value categories that representdifferent values of the social sciences. 
To solve the task, two different approaches wereconsidered: one based on Support Vector Machine(SVM) and the other one based on transformer-basedmodels, in particular BERT, XLNet andRoBERTa.The results obtained show that the transformer-basedmodels allow to achieve better performanceoverall: indeed, the best performingmodel was RoBERTa.
